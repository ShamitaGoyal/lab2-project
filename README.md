# Lab 2 â€” A GUI application that visualizes monthly rainfall in San Francisco

This application uses data from [climate of SF](https://ggweather.com/sf/monthly.html) to get data of monthly rainfall from years 1850-2023.

&#9744; There are two python code files: `rainfall.py` and `lab2.py`

&#9744; One input file: `sf_rainfall.csv`

&#9744; To run the program: have the three files as listed above in your IDE, and simply run the `lab2.py` file

&#9744; This project explores how to write GUI applications using tkinter. However, I have used the `customtkinter` module to make the GUI for my application more modern. The documentation and information about this module can be found here on this [website](https://customtkinter.tomschimansky.com/) or on [Github](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter).

----------
### Modules you may need to install in your IDE to run the program:
- `pip install numpy`
- `pip install matplotlib`
- `pip install customtkinter`
